// town-views.mjs — the Town page's pieces, and what each address on it opens
// (POS-273; the Town page, POS-278, 2026-09-27).
//
// Imported by the page's own script as well as by bulletin-board.mjs and the
// suite, so it imports nothing: the browser bundle carries only this file.

// ── THE BOARD HOLDS THE TOWN (POS-273, 2026-09-27; the Town page, POS-278) ──
//
// Keemin: "I want the civic quarter and the meeps to themselves be pins on the
// bulletin board … the clicks should show you that component integrated into
// the one cork board page." And, the same day, of the panel that first did it:
// "I'm also generally not a fan of the whole pop-up window. could we try
// containing everything in the town's page, and simply having the corkboard
// move to the left and get replaced by the page contents of whatever you
// clicked? with a clear 'back to board' arrow".
//
// So a piece's click slides the board off to the left and its content fills
// the page. A piece's `hash` is that view's address on /bulletin/, so a view
// can be linked and Back returns to the board; its `page` is where it lives on
// its own, and what the piece links to with JavaScript off. NO ELEMENT ON THE
// PAGE CARRIES ONE OF THESE HASHES AS ITS ID: a fragment that names an id is a
// fragment the browser scrolls to, and nothing on this page auto-scrolls.
//
// In Keemin's order, which is also the phone's order down the board.

 * The pieces whose view is another page, framed, and loaded only on open

 * quarter's or the meeps' markup). The Daily is the office's own html; the
 * quarter and the meeps are their own pages at `?embed`, framed whole, so
 * their switches run as they do at home and there is one source of each
 * (Wright's ruling on POS-273). The page is the same static file either way,
 * so a visit without ?embed is untouched: `dress` means the board, from
 * outside, puts one class on the framed page and the CSS that class wears
 * (the site chrome off); the Daily has no chrome to take off. Both pages
 * carry a canonical link to their bare URL, which is what ?embed resolves to.
 * `deep` is the prefix by which a hash on /bulletin/ reaches INTO the framed
 * page: /bulletin/#quarter-quests opens the quarter on the Quest Guild. The
 * prefix keeps the quarter's own ids (quests, marketplace, board) apart from
 * this page's addresses, where two of them are notice slugs.
